/// Code to detect cases where using `!` (never-type) fallback instead of `()` fallback
/// may result in the introduction of undefined behavior;
///
/// TL;DR: We look for method calls whose arguments are all inhabited, but
/// that have a generic parameter (e.g. `T` in `fn foo<T>() { ... } `)
/// that's uninhabited due to fallback. We emit an error, forcing
/// users to add explicit type annotations indicating whether they
/// actually want the `!` type, or something else.
///
/// Background: When we first tried to enable never-type fallback, it was found to
/// cause code in the 'obj' crate to segfault. The root cause was a piece
/// of code that looked like this:
///
/// ```rust
///fn unconstrained_return<T>() -> Result<T, String> {
///     let ffi: fn() -> T = transmute(some_pointer);
///     Ok(ffi())
/// }
///fn foo() {
///     match unconstrained_return::<_>() {
///         Ok(x) => x,  // `x` has type `_`, which is unconstrained
///         Err(s) => panic!(s),  // â€¦ except for unifying with the type of `panic!()`
///         // so that both `match` arms have the same type.
///         // Therefore `_` resolves to `!` and we "return" an `Ok(!)` value.
///     };
///}
/// ```
///
/// Previously, the return type of `panic!()` would end up as `()` due to fallback
/// (even though `panic()` is declared as returning `!`). This meant that
/// the function pointer would get transmuted to `fn() -> ()`.
///
/// With never-type fallback enabled, the function pointer was transmuted
/// to `fn() -> !`, despite the fact that it actually returned. This lead
/// to undefined behavior, since we actually "produced" an instance of `!`
/// at runtime.
///
/// We want to prevent this code from compiling, unless the user provides
/// explicit type annotations indicating that they want the `!` type to be used.
///
/// However, we want code like this to continue working:
///
/// ```rust
/// fn foo(e: !) -> Box<dyn std::error::Error> {
///    Box::<_>::new(e)
/// }```
///
/// From the perspective of fallback, these two snippets of code are very
/// similar. We have some expression that starts out with type `!`, which
/// we replace with a divergent inference variable. When fallback runs,
/// we unify the inference variable with `!`, which leads to other
/// expressions getting a type of `!` as well (`Box<!>` in this case),
/// becoming uninhabited as well.
///
/// Our task is to distinguish things that are "legitimately" uninhabited,
/// (such as `Box<!>` in the second example), from things that are
/// "suspiciously" uninhabited and may lead to undefined behavior
/// (the `Result<!, !>` in the first example).
///
/// The key difference between these two snippets of code turns out
/// to be the *arguments* used in a function call. In the first example,
/// we call `unconstrained_return` with no arguments, and an inferred
/// type parameter of `!` (a.k.a `unconstrained_return::<!>()`).
///
/// In the second example, we call `Box::new(!)`, again inferring
/// the type parameter to `!`. Since at least one argument to `Box::new`,
/// is uninhabited, we know that this call is *statically unreachable* -
/// if it were ever executed, we would have instantaited an uninhabited
/// type for a parameter, which is impossible. This means that while
/// the fallback to `!` has affected the type-checking of this call,
/// it won't actually affect the runtime behavior of the call, since
/// the call can never be executed.
///
/// In the first example, the call to `unconstrained_return::<!>()` is
/// still (potentially) live, since it trivially has no uninhabited arguments
/// (it has no arguments at all). This means that our fallback to `!` may
/// have changed the runtime behavior of `unconstrained_return` (in this case,
/// it did) - we may actually execute the call at runtime, but with an uninhabited
/// type parameter that the user did not intend to provide.
///
/// This distinction forms the basis for our lint. We look for
/// any function/method calls that meet the following requirements:
///
/// * Unresolved inference variables are present in the generic substs prior to fallback
/// * All arguments are inhabited
/// * After fallback, at least one generic subsst is uninhabited.
///
/// Let's break down each of these requirements:
///
/// 1. We only look at method calls, not other expressions.
/// This is because the issue boils down to a generic subst being
/// uninhabited due to fallback. Generic parameters can only be used
/// in two places - as arguments to types, and arguments to methods.
/// We don't care about types - the only relevant expression would be
/// a constructor (e.g. `MyStruct { a: true, b: 25 }`). In and of itself,
/// constructing a type this way (after all field values are evaluated)
/// can never cause undefined behavior.
///
/// Methods calls, on the other hand, might cause undefined behavior
/// due to how they use their generic paramters. Note that this
/// still true if the undefineed behavior occurs in the same function
/// where fallback occurs - there still must be a call `transmute`
/// or some other intrinsic that allows 'instantating' an `!` instance
/// somehow.
///
/// 2. Only function calls with inference variables in their generic
/// substs can possibly be affected by fallback - if all types are resolved,
/// then fallback cannot possibly have any effect.
///
/// 3. If any arguments are uninhabited, then the function call cannot ever
/// cause undefined behavior, since it can never be executed. This check
/// ensures that we don't lint on `Box::<_>::new(!)` - even though
/// we're inferring a generic subst (`_`) to `!`, it has no runtime
/// effect.
///
/// 4. If a generic substs is uninhabited after fallback, then we have
/// the potential for undefined behavior. Note that this check can
/// have false positives - if a generic argument was already uninhabited
/// prior to fallback, we might end up triggering the lint even if fallback
/// didn't cause any generic substs to become uninhabited. However, this isn't
/// a big deal for a few reasons:
///
/// * This lint should be incredibly rare (as of the time of writing, only
/// `obj` has run into the relevant issue).
/// * Even if fallback didn't cause anything to become uninhabited
/// (e.g. a `*const _` being inferred to `*const !`), it's still influencing
/// the generic substs of a potentially live (all arguments inhabited) function
/// call. This is arguably something worth linting against, since the user
/// might not be aware that a live call is being affected by a seemingly
/// unrelated expression.
///
/// * It should always be possible to resolve this lint while keeping the
/// existing behavior, simply by adding explicit type annotations. This
/// ensures that fallback never runs (since the type variable will
/// actually be constrained to `!` or something else). At worst,
/// we will force users to write some arguably unecessary type annotation,
/// but we will not permanently break any code.
